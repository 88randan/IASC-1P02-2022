Hi im Brandan Quach.In my first year of undergraduate studies, no course has left a positive impact on me more than IASC F01 labs. At the beginning of this course, I showed a standard knowledge of common media use. From video editing, basic HTML, and photo editing. This class gave me the opportunity to exceed and gain more knowledge within those fields. I really enjoyed all the projects and completed everything on time. I attended all the classes I could and always wanted to gain more skills and knowledge while learning. That being said with the work completed and the newly gained skills I've gained I think I deserve a 4 out of 5 in this class. To begin this reflection I want to speak about the skills and knowledge that I've gained from being in these course labs while also showcasing my least and favorite tools and assignments. From tools to techniques I want to say I've gained the most skills within the “Twine Story” assignment. It has greatly impacted me and taught me many new techniques where I can use the skills I already know to build into a game. Before I knew how to HTML code, video edit and write but this gave me the opportunity to put it all together to make a game. This had to be one of my favorite assignments and would love to push forward with this in the future. This specific assignment opened a gate into story writing which I didn't know I enjoyed before. Another skill I learned was within audio. While doing the audacity labs I got the chance to cancel out white noise, cut clips, and add music. This gave me an understanding of how certain music and audio clips can align to create certain moods. For my career, I want to go into game design and writing and I definitely needed this understanding for future endeavors for sound fx, background music, etc. While these are my favorite tools and skills I've learned from these labs I have to say they all taught me new skills and I didn't really have a least favorable lesson. They all taught me new skills or improved skills from before which I really like. What I think could be improved within these labs are lab participation marks. We complete the work and gain new skills which is what we are supposed to do but I think there should be a mark for people who don't do the work in the class or participate. Participating plays a huge role within the class, Putting up your hand, giving input, and completing the work encourages and boosts others within the class. In my future IASC career, I want to learn and focus more on the design and writing aspects of things. Within this program, I think I can gain a strong structure within media and can definitely build for what I want to do in the future. I understand I will run into a few bumps but I am ready for this. I’m not only learning new skills and tools but learning about myself. Being in this class I hope to build a big portfolio and im so excited for what's to come.
