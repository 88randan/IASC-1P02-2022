      <p> Portfolios need to represent you and show your work and information about you as best as possible. As I progress with my studies in IASC I wanted to keep a record of my past assignments and work so I can reflect on myself and improve as time goes on. I went with a simplistic and modern design that is very minimalist. I wanted to keep this website to a queue making it not too overcomplicated. I often find websites with too much on them just not visually appealing.

For my first page, I wanted to easily show what the viewer is here for, My portfolio. My homepage is a little introduction to me saying hello and giving them a glimpse of who I am before they get to fully look into my website. I then have texts under it that are linked to the about me page and my work page. I wanted to hyperlink it within the text for a more simplistic look. The “Who” links to the about me page that discusses who I am and the “My real” links to the portfolio page that shows my real work. The colors I used for the main page are toned white, gunmetal grey, and black. The colors are really resting on the eyes. I used contrast on the first page by making the background a simplistic white color. The white background makes the text really shine and pop out as it's what I want the viewer to see. The black and gunmetal text forces the viewer to look at them. I then made the Text centered and really big. When you open the website it's directly in front of your face to read. I feel as if the font I used is really good and common. Not too strong or light it quickly guides the reader’s eye from letter to letter which I very much like “Bolding” the text.

For my second page, I wanted it to be about me showing information about me and a picture of me to get a visual of who they are reading about. It also has the current date just to update people as to what day it was today. The way I wanted to lay out this page was centered text so it's directly in front of the viewer's face. For contrasts, I didn't want to use a basic black as most of my page had black text so I went with gunmetal. This color is dark enough to be seen with a light-colored background. The background is a light-tone color called “Pewter” it really pops the main text color out.
For my third page, I wanted it to be almost fully dedicated to work. This page shows my artwork and the real work I've done. The way I designed this page was to have my artwork in equal square blocks taking up the majority of the screen. I have very little text under it so the viewer focuses on my work rather than only reading the text. I decided to put a white tint over everything so that when hovering your mouse over the work it glows putting the specific work into the spotlight.
